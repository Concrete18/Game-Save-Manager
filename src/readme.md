## Tests

Use this to run all Rust Tests

```bash
cargo test
```

Tests are designed for my computer and installed games due to the difficulty of creating a test directory for this.

## Benchmarking

Use this to run a Rust benchmark showing if the code is faster now then it was before.
This can vary simply based on what your system is doing currently. Try to run the old version and new version with a short gap by using something like the `git stash` git command so you can get the best idea of how it is changing.

```bash
cargo bench
```
